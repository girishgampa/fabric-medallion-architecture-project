# 🚀 End-to-End Microsoft Fabric Data Engineering Project

> An end-to-end Data Engineering solution built using **Microsoft Fabric**, **PySpark**, **Delta Lake**, **Medallion Architecture**, **Semantic Models**, and **Power BI** to transform raw e-commerce data into business-ready analytics.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a modern data engineering pipeline using **Microsoft Fabric** and the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)**.

Starting from raw CSV files, the project ingests, transforms, and models data into a Star Schema before building a Semantic Model and interactive Power BI dashboards for business reporting.

The solution follows industry best practices for data ingestion, transformation, dimensional modeling, and analytics.
